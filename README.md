# Undergrad-Class-Work

This repository contains a collection of coding projects and assignments completed during my undergraduate Computer Science studies at the University of Central Florida. Each directory corresponds to a specific course, with a detailed description of the contents available inside. Below is an overview of the courses, organized by the semester I took them, and a brief summary of the topics covered.

### Spring 2022
**Computer Science 1 (COP 3502)** 
This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving, with a focus on data structures and algorithm analysis using the C programming language. Key concepts include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, and algorithm efficiency.

### Fall 2022
**Computer Science 2 (COP 3503)** 
A continuation of Computer Science I, this course delves deeper into advanced data structures and algorithmic techniques using Java. Topics covered include trees, hash tables, heaps, graphs, and more complex algorithmic paradigms like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

**Security in Computing (CIS3360)** 
An introduction to computer security concepts and practices, with a focus on cryptography, network security, and system vulnerabilities. The coursework includes implementations in C and Java, covering topics such as encryption algorithms, authentication mechanisms, and secure programming.

### Spring 2023
**Processes of Object Oriented Software Development (COP4331)** 
This course covers the software development lifecycle, focusing on building scalable and robust web applications. It includes topics like software design patterns, agile development, version control, testing, and full-stack web development. Projects involve designing and implementing software using both front-end and back-end technologies.
