# Security in Computing Programming Assignments

The course provided a fundamental understanding of security theory and practices in modern computing environments. It covered various cryptographic techniques, including both symmetric and public-key cryptography, alongside essential security concepts.

## Assignment 1 Vigènere Cipher (in C)

This assignment was oriented around the Vigènere Cipher which encrypts text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a key. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with file encryption in C. The program reads an encryption key and a plaintext file, then produces a ciphertext by applying the Vigenère Cipher. The solution leverages C's ability to manipulate characters as ASCII values, performing calculations to shift characters accordingly.

## Assignment 2 Checksum (in Java)

Assignment 2 was oriented around being able to calculate 8, 16, & 32 bit checksum. The program accepts both the checksum size and a text file as command-line inputs, then calculates the corresponding checksum value. The implementation uses Java’s `StringBuilder` class to efficiently handle string modifications while calculating padding and the final checksum result. This assignment highlighted the importance of data integrity and error detection in secure computing.
