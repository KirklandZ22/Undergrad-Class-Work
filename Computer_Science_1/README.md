# Computer Science 1 Course Work

This course provided an introduction to data structures and algorithms, with all assignments completed in C. Each folder contains the C source file for the assignment, along with a README.md file explaining the purpose and approach for each task. All code is well-documented and commented to aid understanding.


## Assignment 1 Numeronym 

In this assignment, the focus was on string manipulation. The objective was to create a program that converts words into numeronyms—abbreviations that condense words into their first and last letters, with the number of omitted characters in between. The program specifically targeted words with nine or more characters.

## Assignment 2 Lonely Party Array

This assignment involved implementing Lonely Party Arrays (LPAs), which are fragmented arrays that dynamically allocate and deallocate memory as needed. The goal was to eliminate unnecessary memory allocation by only allocating space for fragments when required, rather than pre-allocating a large array at once.

## Assignment 3 Listy String

The goal of Assignment 3 was to work with linked lists to represent strings. A series of functions were created to construct and manipulate these linked list-based strings. The assignment emphasized modifying the strings through operations such as concatenation, deletion, and replacement, all within the linked list structure.

## Assignment 4 Kindred Spirits

This assignment explored recursion within the context of binary trees. A series of recursive functions were implemented to compare two binary trees and determine whether they are "kindred spirits"—i.e., whether one tree can be transformed into the other by mirroring or rearranging its structure.

## Assignment 5 Trie Prediction 

In this final assignment, a trie (prefix tree) was implemented to both store a corpus of words and predict text. This structure was chosen for its efficiency in handling large sets of strings. The trie was designed to suggest words based on words that came before it, simulating text prediction functionality.
