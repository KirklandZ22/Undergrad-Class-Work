# Computer Science 2 Course Work

This advanced course delved deeper into data structures and algorithms, with an emphasis on runtime and space complexity. The assignments required not only the implementation of complex data structures but also the evaluation of their efficiency. All code for this class was written in Java, and each folder contains the respective Java file along with a README.md that explains the purpose of the assignment. The code is well-documented and includes comments for clarity.

## Assignment 1 Sneaky Queens

In this assignment, the task was to determine whether any queens on a randomly sized chessboard could attack one another. This required efficiently checking the positions of the queens to ensure that none shared the same row, column, or diagonal, thereby avoiding potential attacks.

## Assignment 2 Generic Binary Search Tree

This assignment involved implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) while using Java generics to allow the tree to store any comparable type of data. The goal was to ensure that the BST retained its typical structure and search efficiency while accommodating different data types.

## Assignment 3 Sneaky Knights

Assignment 3 followed the same logic as Assignment 1 but instead focused on knights instead of queens. The goal was to ensure that none of the knights on the board could attack each other based on their unique movement capabilities, adding an additional layer of complexity to the problem.

## Assignment 4 Skip List

In this assignment, the task was to implement a Skip List, a probabilistic data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. This was achieved using generic comparable classes, making the Skip List flexible and efficient for different types of data.

## Assignment 5 Constrained Topological Sort

This assignment explored topological sorting in directed graphs with added constraints. The objective was to determine whether a valid topological order could exist while adhering to specific restrictions, highlighting the complexity of sorting when additional dependencies are imposed on a graph.

## Assignment 6 N/A

Due to instructor policy, Assignment 6 is not included. This assignment involved a backtracking problem set in a maze, where the objective was to find a solution by exploring potential paths and backtracking when dead ends were encountered.

## Assignment 7 Run Like Hell

In this dynamic programming assignment, the problem was to select items from a list while ensuring that if one item was chosen, its neighboring items could not be selected. The goal was to find the optimal solution using a clever strategy to maximize the overall value of the selected items while adhering to the constraints.
